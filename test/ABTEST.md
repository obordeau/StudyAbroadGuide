### A/B Test Name: Method for searching 
# User Story Number: US#
# Metric (from the HEART grid): Session duration, Screens seen during session, number of searches 

# Hypothesis: 

  -Problem: Users are currently struggling to find universities efficiently using the 
  existing search method, resulting in shorter session durations and fewer screens viewed during a session. 
  The application will implement two methods of searching for a university to test which one leads to increased user engagement.
  
 

# #Experiment:
  -we will allocate 50% of our active user base to the experiment. All users will have the opportunity to view the experiment. 


  -Set up event tracking for interactions with the search feature.
   -Track the number of searches commited.
   -Measure the session duration for users in both variations (A and B).
   -Monitor user engagement with the new search methods and the existing method.
  
# Variations:

 -the second variation(B) introduces a new search method addressing the hypothesis. We believe that the new search method will
  provide users with more relevant and filterd search results and an improved user interface. The variation B will have a page dedicated to filter the 
  Universities displayed based on criteria selected by the user.
  -the mock up of a new search function will be a dropdown checkbox that have criteria that will filter the list of schools. 
  
  _Variation A (the control) provides a baseline for comparison, allowing us to measure the impact of the new search method. This variation A will only
  have the simple search bar.
