# A/B Test Name: Method for searching 
## User Story Number: 7
## Metric (from the HEART grid): Session duration, Screens seen during session, number of searches 

## Hypothesis: 

  -Problem: Users are currently struggling to find universities efficiently using the 
  existing search method, resulting in shorter session durations and fewer screens viewed during a session. 
  The application will implement two methods of searching for a university to test which one leads to increased user engagement.
  
 

## Experiment:
  -we will allocate 50% of our active user base to the experiment. All users will have the opportunity to view the experiment. 

  -Set up event tracking for interactions with the search feature.
  
  -Track the number of searches commited.
  
  -Measure the session duration for users in both variations (A and B).
  
  -Monitor user engagement with the new search methods and the existing method.
  
## Variations:

 -the second variation(B) introduces a new search method addressing the hypothesis. We believe that the new search method will
  provide users with more relevant and filterd search results and an improved user interface. The variation B will have a page dedicated to filter the 
  Universities displayed based on criteria selected by the user.
  -the mock up of a new search function will be a dropdown checkbox that have criteria that will filter the list of schools. 
  
  -Variation A (the control) provides a baseline for comparison, allowing us to measure the impact of the new search method. This variation A will only
  have the simple search bar. 



# A/B Test Name: Method to increase user engagement and interaction 
## User Story Number:  2,3,4
## Metric (from the HEART grid):  User reactivation rate, user leaves review for university page, chats messages sent

## Hypothesis: 

  -Problem: Users don't want to leave review and feedback for other users who are looking for advice from previous students because they may think leaving a review is too time consuming. This is a significaant problem becaause our app is revolved around user interaction and user engagement. To encourage more review and feedback, we can simplify the process and make it quicker to get through.
  
 

## Experiment:
  - We wil have 50% of our user base have the feature to leave a simple star rating for each category such as food, accommodation, transportation, and the overall university rating. The other 50% will still have to leave a written reviews.

  - Keep track of the number of users leaving reviews on the university pages

  - Pay attention to any changes in the amount of user interactions

  - Compare the number of reviews that users gave in both versions of the app

  - Compaare the amount of user interaction in both versions of the app 
  
## Variations:

 - In the first variation, users will be able to leave a star rating from 1-5 for a university and it's food, accommodation, and transportation. This will drastically simplify the rating process and the users will not have to spend too much time thinking and drafting up a written review.
 - In the second variation, users have only be able to write reviews. With this version, we are able to compare the 2 different ways a user can leave a review, and figure out which one is more effective for increasing user engagement and interaction.
