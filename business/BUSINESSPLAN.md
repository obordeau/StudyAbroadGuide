# Business Model

## Lean Canvas Business Model
The Lean Canvas approach is a one-page business model that serves as a simplified and condensed version of a traditional business plan. In the development of our new app, "StudyAbroadGuide," we are employing the Lean Canvas approach to streamline our vision and strategy. This approach will allow us to focus on the essential ellements of our app's customer segments, revenue model, and hone in on who exactly the app is intended for. This model will allows to make quick adjustments as our vision and strategy is ever-changing.
