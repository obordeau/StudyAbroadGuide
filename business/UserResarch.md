|Observation 1 : A feature that users want  | A few respondents wanted a feature to be able to compare two programs and universities side by side to see their pros and cons. | In our open-ended question, “What features do you want to see implemented in the app?”, we got the following responses: “I want to see a feature where I can compare two universities side by side.”, “It can have a function of comparing two different programs, just like buying an iPhone”, “Pros and cons of different options, how to plan, and a feature to meet other people doing the same plan to make connections prior to traveling.” | Our team can implement a screen where there is a comparison of two programs side by side. |
| Observation 2 : Information on the user profile | People are most interesting in seeing the full name, major/minor, year of study and universities attended for each user in the app. The profile photo and a link to socials could be optionnal.| Answers to the question : "What do you want to see on a user profile?" ![Data](/src/UserProfileInformationData.png)| Each user profile will have mandatory information (full name, major/minor, year of study and universities attended) and optional information (picture, link to socials).|
| Observation 3 : Information on app features | One observation we noticed is what the surveyors are more interested in seeing in our app. The observation is that students want an app that can help not only with what is required of a student at their university, but also an app to help students with their day to day. An app to help students find resources and accommodate making such a big move. | Answers to the question: "What are you most interested in seeing in our app?"![Data](/src/surveydata.png)| Our team can implement a section of our app devoted to preemptively streamline these questions and present solutions based on their university.|
