The Study Abroad Guide will be an app catered to helping students who are looking to study abroad. When choosing which university to study abroad, there are many options that present their own unique opportunities and experiences, making it difficult to narrow down the choices. This app will allow students who have studied abroad to leave their review, feedback and advice to prospect students. Each university will have a page filled with information, and each student will have their own profile. If a student has studied at a particular university, then they can contribute information to their university page. With all the universities' information gathered together in one app, students can easily navigate through the app to compare universities in their target country.
